    intro:
      "Food is the fuel of all things in our universe. What’s the first place you encounter another culture, what are the first of their exports that you try, what is it that first influences you from that country. Invariably it always comes down to food. ",
    body: "Lets look at the nitty gritty, in Chinese food is /shi/wu/ but boy oh boy do those sounds look difficult. The way they are pronounced is like “sure” and “ooo”(like the end of boo!).",
    practice: "Now lets make some sentences practicing with it.",
    question1: " wow! this shiwu is hot",
    question2: "yum! this shiwu is delicious",
    question3: "yuck! this shiwu is cold",

    title: "Foods",
    intro:
      "There are many kinds of food that we consume. The spices and ingredients are similar and different across the world. What’s appropriate to eat, what’s a snack, what’s for dinner (beef?) and what’s served on holidays. ",
    body: "In the sense of foods that we eat and consume it is more common to use the word /cai/ it looks easy but is a bit tricky to pronounce. The ‘c’ is made of the sound ‘ts’ and the ‘ai’ makes the sound “I” like ‘I am’",
    practice: ' "Now lets make some sentences practicing with it." ',
    question1: " I like Japanese cai (cusine)",
    question2: " I want to eat cai(food) ",
    question3: " I like spicy cai (food) ",

  {
    title: "Have you eaten?",
    intro:
      "One difference between Chinese and English is the way we greet each other. In English it is common to ask “How are you?” We aren’t really asking what happening their life. We are asking if they are okay or not and just being polite. In Chinese there is a similar saying but it isn’t a direct translation",
    body: "In Chinese we ask “Have you eaten?” and the answer is pretty much always “yea I have eaten” we do this by using another version of the word food /fan/. The sound is a normal f sound but the “an” the a makes the sound ahh like “open up and say ahh” and then then the n sound is just like in normal English. “Fan ” literally means rice, but it also used for a meal and literally rice .",
    practice: "Now lets make some sentences practicing with it.",
    question1: "Have you eaten fan",
    question2: " I ate morning fan (breakfast) ",
    question3: " I'll have one order of fried fan ",
