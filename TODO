TODO List

-   Program needs to store all data from the back end into a setStore function. <store.myLesson1>
    

-   After this we must set up a function to store an array of number up to the length of the setStore function
        example: If the setStore function has a length of 2 elements then we will have an array called count and this
        array will consist of numbers [0,1].

-   From here the program needs to randomly sort the count array and the program will choose the first 5 elements 
    of the count array
